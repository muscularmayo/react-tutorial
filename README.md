# react-tutorial
in this repository - this is my first experience initializing my own repo and doing all the associated things.

in this repository i am going to do both the react-tutorial and the react-hello-world sequence and try to get a better understanding of the things going on in react, then i will use this knowledge to do some kinda grocery list.

in order:
1. hello world
2. tic-tac-toe
3. grocery list
